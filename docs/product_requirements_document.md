# InternVL Receipt Counter: Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

The InternVL Receipt Counter is a vision-language multimodal application designed for taxation officers to accurately count, analyze, and extract information from receipt images. Built on InternVL2's advanced vision-language architecture, this system enables natural language interaction with visual receipt data, allowing officers to ask questions about receipts and receive accurate responses based on the visual content.

This document serves as the single source of truth for the project requirements, specifications, and implementation plan across all development stages.
