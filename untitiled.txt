‚è∫ We've successfully reorganized the codebase. Here's what we've
  accomplished:

  1. Created a Logical Directory Structure:
    - Separated code by function: classification, data generation, and
  model training
    - Added clear documentation with README files for each major component
    - Properly organized configuration files
  2. Fixed Import Statements:
    - Updated the import paths in all files to match the new structure
    - Fixed project root path calculations to account for the deeper
  directory structure
    - Updated 28 files with the import update script
  3. Cleaned Up Legacy Files:
    - Moved old files to the archive directory
    - Removed redundant files
    - Properly organized all components
  4. Added Documentation:
    - Created README files for all major directories
    - Added a comprehensive project README
    - Created a detailed reorganization summary

  The codebase is now better organized, with a clear structure that aligns
  with the three main components:
  1. Enhanced Question Classifier
  2. Synthetic Data Generation
  3. InternVL Model Fine-tuning

  To test this reorganization, you can run:

  # Test the question classifier
  PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/classification/train_enhanced_classifier.py
  --num-epochs 3

  # Generate synthetic data
  PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/data_generation/generate_data.py --output_dir
   datasets/test_synthetic --num_collages 3

  # Train the InternVL model
  PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/training/train_multimodal.py --config
  config/model/multimodal_config.yaml

  This reorganization makes the codebase much more maintainable and easier
  to understand for new developers.
