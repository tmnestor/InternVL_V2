# Question Classification Improvement Results

## Overview

We have implemented the improvements outlined in the classification improvement plan to enhance the question classifier's performance. While the model is still training, initial results show significant improvements in class balance and accuracy.

## Implemented Improvements

1. **Dataset Balancing**
   - Created a balanced dataset with equal representation (70 examples each) for all 5 classes
   - Added diverse examples for each class, including:
     - Questions with different phrasing styles
     - Questions with adverbs and qualifiers
     - Australian context-specific examples
     - Adversarial examples that challenge the model's understanding

2. **Loss Function Enhancement**
   - Implemented Focal Loss to focus training on hard examples
   - Added class weights using the strategy: [1.75, 0.88, 0.44, 0.18, 1.75]
   - Incorporated label smoothing (0.1) to prevent overconfidence

3. **Training Strategy Adjustments**
   - Added gradient clipping (1.0) to stabilize training
   - Implemented cosine learning rate schedule with warmup
   - Added early stopping based on macro F1 score (which better handles class imbalance)

4. **Evaluation Improvements**
   - Enhanced monitoring with per-class metrics
   - Added confusion matrix visualization
   - Implemented detailed error analysis for worst-performing classes
   - Added F1 score tracking (micro, macro, weighted) alongside accuracy

## Current Results

After initial training, the model shows:

1. **Training Metrics**:
   - Average loss: 0.9105
   - Accuracy: 34.57%
   - F1 score (macro): 0.3105
   - Per-class accuracy:
     - DOCUMENT_TYPE: 58.57%
     - COUNTING: 61.43%
     - DETAIL_EXTRACTION: 2.86%
     - PAYMENT_INFO: 15.71%
     - TAX_INFO: 34.29%

2. **Validation Metrics**:
   - Average loss: 0.5963
   - Accuracy: 55.14%
   - F1 score (macro): 0.4770
   - Per-class accuracy:
     - DOCUMENT_TYPE: 98.57%
     - COUNTING: 82.86%
     - DETAIL_EXTRACTION: 17.14%
     - PAYMENT_INFO: 0.00%
     - TAX_INFO: 77.14%

3. **Confusion Matrix Analysis**:
   - DOCUMENT_TYPE: Generally well-classified
   - COUNTING: Strong classification
   - DETAIL_EXTRACTION: Confusion with DOCUMENT_TYPE and TAX_INFO
   - PAYMENT_INFO: Major confusion with TAX_INFO (all examples misclassified)
   - TAX_INFO: Moderate confusion with DOCUMENT_TYPE

## Issues and Next Steps

1. **Addressing PAYMENT_INFO Classification**
   - The model is misclassifying all PAYMENT_INFO questions as TAX_INFO
   - Need to increase the class weight for PAYMENT_INFO further
   - Add more distinctive PAYMENT_INFO examples to better separate from TAX_INFO

2. **Improving DETAIL_EXTRACTION**
   - Still has low accuracy (17.14%)
   - Add more clearly differentiated examples
   - Consider feature engineering to better capture the specific patterns of detail extraction questions

3. **Continue Training**
   - The model has only gone through 1 out of 3 planned epochs
   - Complete training to allow it to better learn the patterns

4. **Model Architecture Enhancements**
   - Consider using a more powerful base model (RoBERTa or BERT-large)
   - Add specialized attention mechanisms for question classification

## Conclusion

The enhanced classifier shows improvements in class balancing and overall approach, but still requires further refinement. The most critical issue to address is the PAYMENT_INFO class, which is entirely misclassified. Continuing training and applying the targeted improvements mentioned above should lead to better performance.

The simplified test demonstrates that DOCUMENT_TYPE and COUNTING questions are now classified correctly, which is an improvement over the previous model. However, work remains to be done on the other classes.

Overall, we are on the right track with our improvement plan, and further iterations will help achieve the target of 80% overall accuracy and 70% minimum per-class accuracy.
